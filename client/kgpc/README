This KGP client takes care of the protocol, and invokes a seperate
process for every request:

	$ kgpc kalah.kwarc.info ./some-client --with args

In this example, the program "some-client --with args" will now be
invoked every time a move is requested.  The board state will be
transfered via the standard input as sequence of non-negative
integers:

	3
	0 1
	2 4 5
	6 7 8

This should be parsed as "A board with three pits on every side (south
has 2 stones in it's first pit, 4 in it's second, 5 in the third,
north has 6 in it's first pit, etc.).  The southern store has 0 stones
and the northern store has 1".  The agent now has to decide what move
the south side should make.  The decision should be written onto the
standard output as a 0-indexed number designating the pit to sow.

You can then terminate your process, yielding your time, or continue
to improve your previous decision by outputting (hopefully) better
moves.

Kgpc will run as long as the connection persists.  You can connect
both via TCP and Websocket.  For websocket connections, you need to
add a "ws://" or "wss://" to the server address:

	$ kgpc wss://kalah.kwarc.info/socket ./other-client

You can set a token, author and agent name by setting the
environmental variables TOKEN, AUTHOR and NAME respectivly.

Here is a basic C++ agent that could be invoked by kgpc:

    #include <iostream>

    // This is a simple C++ agent that would work with kgpc.  It
    // demonstrates how to parse the input, but does not implement
    // anything else.  It will always return the left-most move.

    int main()
    {
	 int size, south, north;
	 std::cin >> size >> south >> north;
	 int spits[size], npits[size];
	 for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) std::cin >> spits[i];
	 for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) std::cin >> npits[i];
	 for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
	      if (spits[i] > 0) {
		   std::cout << i+1 << std::endl;
		   return 0;
	      }
	 }
	 return 1;
    }

To build kgpc, you need a Go toolchain[0], and then to run

	$ go build

This should result in a kgpc binary.  The executable is statically
bound and can be moved around anywhere on the file system.
